# Best Pretrained Models Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of two popular pretrained models: VGG16 and Xception. The implementations are provided in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb) for easy understanding and execution.

## VGG16 Model

### VGG16.ipynb

The VGG16 implementation includes data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. The notebook is designed to run on a GPU (T4) for accelerated processing.

## Xception Model
### Xception.ipynb
The Xception model implementation follows a similar structure to the VGG16 notebook, covering data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Usage
- Open the respective notebook (VGG16.ipynb or Xception.ipynb) in a Jupyter environment.
- Execute the cells sequentially to load data, preprocess it, build the model, train, and evaluate.
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (tensorflow, numpy, etc.).
- Feel free to explore and modify the notebooks based on your specific needs. If you encounter any issues, check the GPU availability and adjust the code accordingly.

Happy modeling!
